Bash is a well-known and powerful way to run programs, and the default shell on most Linux distros.
Knowing the basics is important, but knowing more advanced features can drastically increase productivity.

## Readline Commands
```
Ctrl-A     - Beginning of Line
Ctrl-E     - End of Line
Ctrl-W     - Delete word back
Alt-D      - Delete word forwards
Ctrl-U     - Delete to start of line
Ctrl-K     - Delete to end of line
Ctrl-Y     - Paste (yank) what was cut (deleted)
Ctrl/Alt-F - Forward one char/word
Ctrl/Alt-B - Backward one char/word
Alt-_      - Undo
```

See [Readline Cheatsheet](http://www.catonmat.net/download/readline-emacs-editing-mode-cheat-sheet.pdf).

## Search History
```
Ctrl-R/S - Reverse/Forward Search
Ctrl-P/N - Previous/Next one command
!!       - Repeat last command
!abc     - Run last cmd starting with abc
!abc:p   - Print last cmd starting with abc
!$       - Last argument of prev command
ALT-.    - Last argument of prev command
!*       - All arguments of prev command
^abc^123 - Run prev command, subst abc with 123
```

## `ls` Options
```
-A  - Show all but . and ..
-R  - Recursive
-r  - Reverse order
-t  - Sort by last modified
-S  - Sort by file size
-l  - Long listing format
-1q - One file per line (special as ?)
```

## Search Options
```
grep pattern files - Search for pattern in files
grep -i
    - Case insensitive search
grep -r
    - Recursive search
grep -v
    - Inverted search
grep -o
    - Show matched part of file only
find /dir/ -name name*
    - Find files starting with name in dir
find /dir/ -user name
    - Find files owned by name in dir
find /dir/ -mmin num
    - Find files modifed less than
      num minutes ago in dir
whereis command
    - Find binary / source / manual for command
locate file
    - Find file (quick search of system index)
```

## File Operations
```
cat file1 file2 - Concatenate files and output
less file1      - View and paginate file1
file file1      - Get type of file1
cp file1 file2  - Copy file1 to file2
mv file1 file2  - Move file1 to file2
rm file1        - Delete file1
head file1      - Show first 10 lines of file1
tail file1      - Show last 10 lines of file1
tail -F file1   - Output last lines of file1 as it changes
```

## Redirection
It's important to understand that each program has 2 outputs and 1 input.
The input is called "standard in" (stdin), and the two outputs are called "standard out" (stdout) and "standard error" (stderr).
Stdout is the typical output of the program.
Stderr is non-typical output of the program that the user should probably see.
Stdin is what goes into the program.

By default, all of these are from the console itself.
Stdout will end up on the console, stdin will be what's typed in, etc.
This can be changed with redirection.

`< filename` will set the stdin of the program to a file:
```
$ nc example.com 1337 < passwords.txt
```

`> filename` will set the stdout of the program to a file:
```
$ ipconfig > network_config.txt
```

`>> filename` will set the stdout of the program to a file, and append to the end:
```
$ ipconfig >> network_config.txt
```

Piping with the `|` character chains commands so the stdout of the left side becomes the stdin of the right side:
```
$ route -n | nc example.com 1337
```

`2>&1` sets the stderr of the program to be the same destination as stdout.
This primarily has the use of piping both stdout and stderr.
```
$ netstat -panut 2>&1 | nc example.com 1337
```

If redirecting to a file, the `2>&1` should generally go last:
```
ps uxeaf > processes.txt 2>&1
```

On bash, you can also use `|&` to pipe both stdout and stderr easily:
```
$ netstat -panut |& nc example.com 1337
```

In the same manner, `&>` can be used.
```
ps uxeaf &> processes.txt
```

## Substitution
`$(cmd)` will expand the output of `cmd` that can be used as a string.
`<(cmd)` can be used to have the output be represented as a filename.
