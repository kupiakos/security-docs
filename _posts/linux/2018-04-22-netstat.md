`netstat` is an incredibly useful tool for discovering open network connections.
It's included on most systems.
However, getting it to tell you what you want, and no more, can be difficult.

## Useful Flags
```
-n, --numeric            don't resolve names
-p, --programs           display PID/Program name for sockets
-l, --listening          display listening server sockets
-a, --all, --listening   display all sockets (default: connected)
-t                       display tcp packets
-u                       display udp packets
-w                       display raw packets
```

## Examples
My go-to set of flags:
```
$ netstat -panut
```

It displays:
- Listening and established connections
- Doesn't resolve hostnames (avoids a DNS lookup)
- Doesn't show Unix sockets, but shows TCP and UDP

This can be combined with `watch` for impressive results:
```
$ sudo watch -d netstat -panut
```

This displays the output of `netstat -panut`, refreshing every 2 seconds and highlighting when changes occur.
