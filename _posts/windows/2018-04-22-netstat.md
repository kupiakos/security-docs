`netstat` is an incredibly useful tool for discovering open network connections.
[Fport](https://www.mcafee.com/sg/downloads/free-tools/fport.aspx) is a useful third-party alternative with more options.

## Useful Flags
```
-a	Displays all active TCP connections and the TCP and UDP ports on which the computer is listening..
-n	Displays active TCP connections, however, addresses and port numbers are expressed numerically and no attempt is made to determine names.
-o	Displays active TCP connections and includes the process ID (PID) for each connection. You can find the application based on the PID on the Processes tab in Windows Task Manager.
```

The set of relevant options is much smaller compared to the Linux version.
